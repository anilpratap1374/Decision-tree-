    "A decision tree classifier is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by recursively partitioning the data into subsets based on the most significant attribute at each node. The result is a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, each branch represents an outcome of that decision, and each leaf node represents the predicted label."

    "The mathematical intuition behind decision tree classification involves concepts such as entropy, information gain (or Gini impurity), and recursive partitioning.\n",
    "1. Entropy:\n",
    "Entropy is a measure of impurity or disorder in a set of data. For a binary classification problem, entropy is defined as:\n",
    "Entropy(s) = -p1 log2 (p1) - p2 log2(p2)\n",
    "where p1 and p2are the proportions of data belonging to each class in the set S. The goal is to minimize entropy, which occurs when a set is pure (contains only one class).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Information Gain:\n",
    "Information gain is used to decide which feature to split on at each node. It measures the reduction in entropy (impurity) after a dataset is split based on a particular feature. The formula for information gain (\n",
    "IG) is:\n",
    "IG(S,A) = Entropy(S) - ∑v∈values(A) ∣Sv∣ / ∣S∣ * Entropy(sv) \n",
    "where:\n",
    "S is the current dataset.\n",
    "A is a feature being considered for the split.\n",
    "values(A) are the possible values that feature A can take.\n",
    "Sv is the subset of S for which feature A has the value v.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Recursive Partitioning:\n",
    "The decision tree algorithm recursively applies the above concepts to partition the data at each node. Here's the general process:\n",
    "i>.Select the Best Split:For each feature, calculate information gain (or Gini impurity) for the potential split.Choose the feature with the highest information gain (or lowest Gini impurity) as the decision attribute for the current node.\n",
    "ii>.Split the Data:Divide the dataset into subsets based on the chosen feature.\n",
    "iii>.Repeat for Child Nodes:Recursively repeat the process for each child node, considering only the subset of data associated with that node.\n",
    "iv>.Stopping Criteria:Terminate the recursion when a stopping criterion is met (e.g., reaching a maximum depth or having a minimum number of samples in a node).\n",
    "v>.Assign Labels:Assign the majority class label of the samples in a leaf node as the predicted label for that node."

    "1. Training the Decision Tree:\n",
    "a. Data Preparation:\n",
    "Collect and prepare a labeled dataset where each instance is associated with its correct class label (0 or 1).\n",
    "b. Building the Tree:\n",
    "The decision tree algorithm is applied to the training data, recursively partitioning the dataset based on feature values.\n",
    "At each node, the algorithm selects the best feature to split on (maximizing information gain or minimizing impurity).\n",

    "c. Labeling the Leaf Nodes:\n",
    "Each leaf node in the tree is assigned the majority class label of the instances in that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Making Predictions:\n",
    "a. Traversing the Tree:\n",
    "For a new, unseen instance, start at the root node of the decision tree.\n",
    "b. Following Decision Rules:\n",
    "At each internal node, follow the decision rule based on the feature value of the instance.\n",
    "Move to the child node that corresponds to the outcome of the decision rule.\n",
    "c. Reaching a Leaf Node:\n",
    "Repeat this process until a leaf node is reached.\n",
    "d. Predicting the Class Label:\n",
    "The predicted class label for the instance is the majority class label of the instances in the leaf node.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a decision tree for spam classification:\n",
    "1.Root Node:\n",
    "Decision: Is the number of words in the email greater than 20?\n",
    "Yes: Go to the left child node.\n",
    "No: Go to the right child node.\n",
    "2.Left Child Node:\n",
    "Decision: Does the email contain the word \"free\"?\n",
    "Yes: Predict \"Spam.\"\n",
    "No: Predict \"Not Spam.\"\n",
